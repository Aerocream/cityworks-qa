# Outstanding Todo Items

[ ] Make tests that pass because of 0 items (e.g. no custom inspections needed) look more like "N/A" than "Passed"
[ ] Allow users to sign-off on manual override of individual checks before status change? (like a button next to each test that a user could click and it would store their stamp and make the test pass).  Would required storing data (but then any override stamping is going to require that anyway)
