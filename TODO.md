# Outstanding Todo Items

 - Make tests that pass because of 0 items (e.g. no custom inspections needed) look more like "N/A" than "Passed"
 - Allow users to sign-off on manual override of individual checks before status change? (like a button next to each test that a user could click and it would store their stamp and make the test pass).  Would required storing data (but then any override stamping is going to require that anyway)
 - Counts of large items are innacurate sometimes.  (See Here)[https://bitbucket.org/watchstevedrum/sacdou-cityworks-qa-plugin/commits/41bf85e0500e8084d7b061449c033a1af7ad6cb9#Ljs/eec-qa.jsT60]
