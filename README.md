### Proxy User

Basically, you need to create a user in Cityworks who has view permissions (but nothing else) to all things you'll need
to test.  It should be an employee, in at least one group (probably only one group, like a system group or something),
and be registered on server with a password.  It doesn't need to be part of any server groups, have any inbox or XML
configuration, employee relates, or anything like that.
